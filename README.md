# Satori CI playbook repository

## Submitting your playbooks

You can contribute your own playbooks here. Satori CI shares part of the profits with the playbooks' creators and authors.

1. Create a fork of our playbook repository by clicking [this link](https://github.com/satorici/playbooks/fork). Click on _Create fork_.
2. Create a new branch in your forked repository:
    1. Below your repository name there's a branch dropdown that says _main_, click it and then click on _View all branches_.
    2. Click _New branch_.
    3. Under _New branch name_, type a name for the branch and click on _Create new branch_.
    4. Select your newly created branch.
4. Create or modify your playbook, either by using the web interface or locally by pushing your changes to your repository.
5. [Click here to open a pull request](https://github.com/satorici/playbooks/compare), make sure you click _compare across forks_. There will be four dropdowns, in the third one select your forked repository and in the last, the branch you created in the second step. Finally click the *Create pull request* button.

We will review your submission as soon as possible.
